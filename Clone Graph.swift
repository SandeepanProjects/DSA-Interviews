Using DFS traversal - O(V+E) Time and O(V) Space

In the DFS approach, the graph is cloned using recursion. We start from the given node and explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. A map (or dictionary) is used to keep track of already cloned nodes to avoid processing the same node multiple times and to handle cycles. When we encounter a node for the first time, we create a clone of it and store it in the map. Then, for each neighbor of that node, we recursively clone it and add the cloned neighbor to the current nodeâ€™s clone. This ensures that all nodes are visited deeply before returning, and the graph structure is faithfully copied.

        return lhs === rhs
